Trouble shooting

if the gui does not apear not to fear, you have 2 opptions.

1. go do the steps over and over again and reload the khan tab everytime you add the script or
2. You can just reaload the tab untill it works but if that does not work do #2. 

If both of thoes dont work then no advanced learning for you! oh well. :)
